## Email Automation Script

Overview

This project automates email data collection by extracting links, modifying URLs, and retrieving emails from web pages. It consists of three Python scripts that work together to streamline the data extraction process.

Scripts & Functionality
1️⃣ Link Collection Auto (link_collection.py)
Automates the extraction of target URLs from specified sources.
Stores collected links for further processing.
2️⃣ URL Modifier (url_modifier.py)
Processes and refines the collected URLs to ensure correct formatting.
Prepares the links for the final data extraction phase.
3️⃣ Main Data Auto (main_data_auto.py)
Extracts email addresses and other relevant information from the modified URLs.
Handles data parsing and storage efficiently.
Installation & Setup
Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Install dependencies using:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure Playwright is set up by running:
bash
Copy
Edit
playwright install
Requirements
The script requires the following Python packages:

pandas – Data manipulation and storage
asyncio – Asynchronous operations
playwright – Browser automation
playwright-stealth – Bypassing bot detection
nest_asyncio – Running async functions in Jupyter or nested loops
os – File and system operations
re – Regular expressions for data extraction
Usage
Run link_collection.py to gather target URLs.
Execute url_modifier.py to refine and modify the collected links.
Run main_data_auto.py to extract emails and store the final dataset.
Known Issues & Considerations
Cloudflare Protection: The script currently bypasses Cloudflare protection successfully, but continued monitoring is required.
Optimization: The script is functional but may require further tuning for efficiency.
